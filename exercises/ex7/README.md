# Exercise 7- Customization of Intelligent Application - Data Access Control

In the previous exercise, we saw how the SAP BDC Admin persona creates the custom-managed version of the Intelligent Application `Working Capital Insights`. In this exercise, we will see how the Data Access Control can be configured in the custom-managed version of the Intelligent Application.

The relational modelling entities or the reuse entities of `Working Capital Insights` are contained in the Datasphere space `SAP_S4H`. As you know, this is an SAP-managed space. Row-level security for the Intelligent Application is also configured in this space.
